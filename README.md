# Pendulum
* Keep track of your pen pals! Add your friends, record when you send them letters or they send something to you. See how long it takes for your letters to arrive!
* Record what pen, ink, and paper you used to write to each person, to keep the variety going each time you write.
* Reminders to write back, or to post letters you've written but have sat by the front door for ages; you won't forget to stay in touch again.
* Sync via iCloud, so you can keep up to date regardless of what device you have to hand.
